                "With the abundance of travel destinations in India, travelers often struggle to find locations that match their specific interests (e.g., Nature, Heritage), time constraints (e.g., Job Type (Remote/Onsite)), and budget. Generic travel sites provide lists but lack personalized, context-aware suggestions.\n",

                "**VoyageSense** aims to build an intelligent recommendation engine that:\n",
                "1.  Understands user preferences (Interest, Budget, Duration, Job Type).\n",
                "2.  Matches them with Indian destinations using **Content-Based Filtering (Cosine Similarity)**.\n",
                "3.  Provides **AI-generated explanations** for *why* a place was recommended using LLMs (Google Gemini). \n",
                "4.  Integrates **Sentiment Analysis** to boost high-quality destinations.\n",

                "### Real-world Relevance & Motivation\n",
                "Tourism is a major economic driver in India, yet the travel planning experience is often fragmented. Travelers spend hours researching across multiple platforms. **VoyageSense** addresses this by providing a **one-stop, personalized solution** that not only suggests places but also explains *why* they fit the traveler's needs, mimics a human travel agent's reasoning, and visualizes the experience through vlogs. This reduces planning time and helps discover hidden gems, boosting local tourism."
